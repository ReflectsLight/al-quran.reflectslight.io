This git repository contains the source code of a statically compiled
website for reading The Quran. After the website is compiled, it consists
of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other static assets that can be hosted on a
regular web server. The repository is optimized for nginx, and (Free|Open)BSD
as a deployment target. The source code is a mixture of Ruby, TypeScript, and
JavaScript with React being the main player on the frontend.
