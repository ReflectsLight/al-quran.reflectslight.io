## About

"Quran" is a library that provides a TypeScript interface to The Holy Quran. <br>
The library assumes the source of data will be provided by the
[ReflectsLight/quran-json](https://github.com/ReflectsLight/quran-json) <br>
repository - a separate project that provides the contents of The Quran in <br>
the JSON format, and in multiple languages.
