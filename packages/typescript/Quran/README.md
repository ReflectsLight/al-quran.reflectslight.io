## About

"Quran" is a library that provides a TypeScript interface <br>
to The Holy Quran. The library assumes the source of data will <br>
be provided by the
[ReflectsLight/quran-json](https://github.com/ReflectsLight/quran-json)
repository - a separate project <br>
that provides the contents of The Quran in the JSON format, <br>
and in multiple languages.
