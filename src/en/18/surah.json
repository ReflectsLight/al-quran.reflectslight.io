So send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city, and let him find which food is the purest, and then bring you provisions from it.

What kind of record is this that does not leave any sin, small or large, unlisted?” They will find whatever they did present ˹before them˺. And your Lord will never wrong anyone."
  ],
  [
    50,
    "And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs, who was one of the jinn, but he rebelled against the command of his Lord. Would you then take him and his descendants as patrons instead of Me, although they are your enemy? What an evil alternative for the wrongdoers ˹to choose˺!"

    "And who does more wrong than those who, when reminded of their Lord’s revelations, turn away from them and forget what their own hands have done? We have certainly cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend this ˹Quran˺—and deafness in their ears. And if you ˹O Prophet˺ invite them to ˹true˺ guidance, they will never be ˹rightly˺ guided."
  ],
  [
    58,
    "Your Lord is the All-Forgiving, Full of Mercy. If He were to seize them ˹immediately˺ for what they commit, He would have certainly hastened their punishment. But they have an appointed time, from which they will find no refuge."

    64,
    "Moses responded, “That is ˹exactly˺ what we were looking for.” So they returned, retracing their footsteps."

  ],
  [
    69,
    "Moses assured ˹him˺, “You will find me patient, Allah willing, and I will not disobey any of your orders.”"

    70,
    "He responded, “Then if you follow me, do not question me about anything until I ˹myself˺ clarify it for you.”"
  ],
  [
    71,
    "So they set out, but after they had boarded a ship, the man made a hole in it. Moses protested, “Have you done this to drown its people? You have certainly done a terrible thing!”"
  ],
  [
    72,
    "He replied, “Did I not say that you cannot have patience with me?”"
  ],
  [
    73,
    "Moses pleaded, “Excuse me for forgetting, and do not be hard on me.”"
  ],
  [
    74,
    "So they proceeded until they came across a boy, and the man killed him. Moses protested, “Have you killed an innocent soul, who killed no one? You have certainly done a horrible thing.”"
  ],
  [
    75,
    "He answered, “Did I not tell you that you cannot have patience with me?”"
  ],
  [
    76,
    "Moses replied, “If I ever question you about anything after this, then do not keep me in your company, for by then I would have given you enough of an excuse.”"
  ],
  [
    77,
    "So they moved on until they came to the people of a town. They asked them for food, but the people refused to give them hospitality. There they found a wall ready to collapse, so the man set it right. Moses protested, “If you wanted, you could have demanded a fee for this.”"
  ],
  [
    78,
    "He replied, “This is the parting of our ways. I will explain to you what you could not bear patiently."
  ],
  [
    79,
    "“As for the ship, it belonged to some poor people, working at sea. So I intended to damage it, for there was a ˹tyrant˺ king ahead of them who seizes every ˹good˺ ship by force."
  ],
  [
    80,
    "“And as for the boy, his parents were ˹true˺ believers, and we feared that he would pressure them into defiance and disbelief."
  ],
  [
    81,
    "So we hoped that their Lord would give them another, more virtuous and caring in his place."
  ],
  [
    82,
    "“And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and under the wall was a treasure that belonged to them, and their father had been a righteous man. So your Lord willed that these children should come of age and retrieve their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do it ˹all˺ on my own. This is the explanation of what you could not bear patiently.” "
  ],
  [
    83,
    "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about Ⱬul-Qarnain. Say, “I will relate to you something of his narrative.”"
  ],
  [
    84,
    "Surely We established him in the land, and gave him the means to all things."
  ],
  [
    85,
    "So he travelled a course,"
  ],
  [
    86,
    "until he reached the setting ˹point˺ of the sun, which appeared to him to be setting in a spring of murky water, where he found some people. We said, “O Ⱬul-Qarnain! Either punish them or treat them kindly.”"
  ],
  [
    87,
    "He responded, “Whoever does wrong will be punished by us, then will be returned to their Lord, Who will punish them with a horrible torment."

  [
    88,
    "As for those who believe and do good, they will have the finest reward, and we will assign them easy commands.”"
  ],
  [
    89,
    "Then he travelled a ˹different˺ course"
  ],
  [
    90,
    "until he reached the rising ˹point˺ of the sun. He found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter from it."
  ],
  [
    91,
    "So it was. And We truly had full knowledge of him."
  ],
  [
    92,
    "Then he travelled a ˹third˺ course"
  ],
  [
    93,
    "until he reached ˹a pass˺ between two mountains. He found in front of them a people who could hardly understand ˹his˺ language."
  ],
  [
    94,
    "They pleaded, “O Ⱬul-Qarnain! Surely Gog and Magog are spreading corruption throughout the land. Should we pay you tribute, provided that you build a wall between us and them?”"
  ],
  [
    95,
    "He responded, “What my Lord has provided for me is far better. But assist me with resources, and I will build a barrier between you and them."
  ],
  [
    96,
    "Bring me blocks of iron!” Then, when he had filled up ˹the gap˺ between the two mountains, he ordered, “Blow!” When the iron became red hot, he said, “Bring me molten copper to pour over it.”"
  ],
  [
    97,
    "And so the enemies could neither scale nor tunnel through it."
  ],
  [
    98,
    "He declared, “This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will level it to the ground. And my Lord’s promise is ever true.”"
  ],
  [
    99,
    "On that Day, We will let them surge ˹like waves˺ over one another. Later, the Trumpet will be blown, and We will gather all ˹people˺ together."
  ],
  [
    100,
    "On that Day We will display Hell clearly for the disbelievers,"
  ],
  [
    101,
    "those who turned a blind eye to My Reminder and could not stand listening ˹to it˺."
  ],
  [
    102,
    "Do the disbelievers think they can ˹simply˺ take My servants as lords instead of Me? We have surely prepared Hell as an accommodation for the disbelievers."

    103,
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Shall we inform you of who will lose the most deeds?"
  ],

    104,
    "˹They are˺ those whose efforts are in vain in this worldly life, while they think they are doing good!”"
  ],

    105,
    "It is they who reject the signs of their Lord and their meeting with Him, rendering their deeds void, so We will not give their deeds any weight on Judgment Day."

  ],
  [
    110,
    "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I am only a man like you, ˹but˺ it has been revealed to me that your God is only One God. So whoever hopes for the meeting with their Lord, let them do good deeds and associate none in the worship of their Lord.”"
