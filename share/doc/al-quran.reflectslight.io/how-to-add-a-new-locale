| Introduction

This post documents the process that should be
followed when adding a new locale or language
to the website.

Ideally the process would require a minimal amount
of manual work and be fast to complete but we're
not quite there yet.

The process:

* Add new locale to file 'Rules'
  (/Rules)
* Add new locale to array 'Quran.locales'
  (/packages/Quran/src/index.ts)
* Add new locale (+ translations)
  (/src/json/t.json)
  (/src/json/surahs.json)
  (/src/json/<locale>/<surahId>/{info,surah}.json)

Note that 'src/json/<locale>/<surahId>/info.json' can
be generated from the contents of 'src/json/surahs.json'
via: 'rake t:surahs.json'
