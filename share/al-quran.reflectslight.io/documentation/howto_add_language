** Introduction

This document explains the process that should be
followed when adding a new locale or language
to the website. Ideally the process would require
a minimal amount of manual work and be fast to complete
but we're not quite there yet.

** Steps

**** Add new locale to file ~/Rules~
The ~/Rules~ file has to be updated

**** Add new locale to array ~Quran.locales~
The ~/packages/Quran/src/index.ts~ file has to be updated

**** Add new locale (+ translations)
The following files have to updated:
+ ~/src/json/t.json~
+ ~/src/json/surahs.json~
+ ~/src/json/<locale>/<surahId>/{info,surah}.json~

**** Save time
The ~/src/json/<locale>/<surahId>/info.json~ files can
be generated from the contents of ~/src/json/surahs.json~ -
and that leaves us with one less step to complete:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  user@localhost$ bundle exec rake t:surahs.json
#+END_SRC
