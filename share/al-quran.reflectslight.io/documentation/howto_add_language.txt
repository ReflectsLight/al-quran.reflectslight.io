* Introduction

This document explains the process that should be
followed when adding a new locale or language
to the website.

Ideally the process would require a minimal amount
of manual work and be fast to complete but we're not
quite there yet.

** Note

Experience has taught me that there's more work than
you might think in maintaining support for a language,
and that starts with finding a good translation.

But it does not end there: the pros and cons of adopting
a new language have to be carefully considered. Going
forward I don't plan to add another language unless a native
speaker can help maintain its support.

* Steps

** Add new locale to file ~/Rules~
The ~/Rules~ file has to be updated

** Add new locale to array ~Quran.locales~
The ~/packages/Quran/src/index.ts~ file has to be updated

** Add new locale (+ translations)
The following files have to updated:
- /src/json/t.json
- /src/json/surahs.json
- /src/json/<locale>/<surahId>/{info,surah}.json

** Save time
The ~/src/json/<locale>/<surahId>/info.json~ files can
be generated from the contents of ~/src/json/surahs.json~ -
and that leaves us with one less step to complete:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  user@localhost$ bundle exec rake t:surahs.json
#+END_SRC
