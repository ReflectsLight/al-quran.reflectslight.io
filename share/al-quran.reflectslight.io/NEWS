* vNEXT

**** Add "cyan" theme
A new theme has been added to the website. The theme is based on
the cyan color scheme, and it is available via the ~ThemeSelect.tsx~
component

**** Replace ~packages/typescript/postman~ with ~@0x1eef/postman~
The ~packages/typescript/postman~ package has been replaced by
~@0x1eef/postman~. The NPM package ~@0x1eef/postman~ includes a
number of improvements over the previous package, including a
more robust and flexible API

**** Add ~tail.rake~
The ~tail:build~ and ~tail:install~ rake tasks can build and install
~tail.css~ from the git submodule available in ~/packages/css/tail.css~.
This change makes it easier to maintain and modify the ~tail.css~ build
process

**** Apply 90% width to surah content
The width of the surah content is now 90% the width of its container.
This change only applies to RTL languages (Arabic, Farsi)

**** Bump height of "refresh" icon
The ~refresh.icon~ was not rendering correctly on my laptop -- with a
part of the icon being cut off. This change fixes the issue by bumping
the height of the icon

**** Remove font-weight classes from ~tail.css~
The font-weight classes have been removed from ~tail.css~ and replaced
by those in ~src/css/base/_typography.scss~. This change was made to
avoid conflicts with the font-weight classes in ~src/css/base/_typography.scss~ --
otherwise the font-weight could be applied incorrectly

**** Add ~src/css/base/_colors.scss~
This new file contains convenience classes for text, background and
border colors that previously lived in ~_base.scss~

**** Add ~src/css/base/_typography.scss~
This new file contains the typography rules for fonts that include
font-family and font-weight convenience classes that target the
variable fonts "Noto Sans", "Noto Sans Arabic", and "Noto Naskh Arabic"

**** Replace "Amiri Quran Regular" with variable "Noto Naskh Arabic" font
The "Amiri Quran Regular" font has been replaced with a variable variant
of the "Noto Naskh Arabic" font. The Arabic version of the website uses
this font to display surah content while other content uses the
"Noto Sans Arabic" font

**** Replace "Cairo" with variable "Noto Sans Arabic" font
The "Cairo" font has been replaced with the variable variant of the
"Noto Sans Arabic" font. The Farsi version of the website now uses
the "Noto Sans Arabic" font exclusively, including for surah content

**** Replace "Kanit Regular" with variable "Noto Sans" font
The "Kanit Regular" font has been replaced with a variable variant
of the "Noto Sans" font. This change gives us more control over the
font weight, which could appear excessively bold on some devices

**** Replace opengraph images with new set of images
The old set of images have been replaced by a new set of images
imported via the [[https://github.com/ReflectsLight/surah-name-glyphs][surah-name-glyphs]] project.
The primary difference is the color scheme, which is now more
vibrant and matches the default "blue" theme used by the
https://al-quran.reflectslight.io website

**** Optimize ~SurahStream.tsx~ for search engine bots
The ~SurahStream.tsx~ component is now rendered immediately for search
engine bots to improve the chances of individual surahs being indexed.
This change is based on the assumption that search engine bots may not
recognize that content is being streamed ayah by ayah, even with
JavaScript enabled

**** Revise meta descriptions
The meta descriptions for all pages were revisited once again, with
an eye to increase uniqueness and quality - particularly for the
surah-stream.html.erb pages

**** Add plurization method to ~T~
A new Ruby method has been added to the ~T~ module. It can determine
what word to use when describing the number of ayahs in a surah. The
Arabic locale is the most nuanced, with different words used depending
on the number of ayah. This method is used during the generation of
meta descriptions

**** Add western numeral => eastern numeral translation method
A new Ruby method has been added to the ~T~ module. It can translate
a western numeral to an eastern numeral, and it is used during the
generation of meta descriptions

**** Extend length of <title> tag
The <title> tag now includes the "The Noble Quran" as text in
addition to the name of the surah. This change was recommended
by the Bing search engine. The previous title was flagged as
too short

**** Add h1 header
The header contains an anchor, and the anchor now wraps its
text within a h1 tag. This change implements a recommendation
from the Bing search engine

**** Replace previous green with a more vibrant green
The previous green theme was too dark, especially on mobile devices.
The new green color is more vibrant, and looks good on both my laptop
and my phone

**** Always render ~SurahIndex.tsx~ with a single column
The ~SurahIndex.tsx~ component now renders one column instead of two
for RTL languages. The change was made to be consistent across all
languages, regardless of their direction

**** Fix bug in the ~LanguageSelect.tsx~ component
The ~LanguageSelect.tsx~ component could render a list of languages
with links all pointing to the same language. We arrived at this
situation because historically a trailing slash was always present.
That's no longer the case since moving to bunny.net and it should
never have been assumed to be the case

**** Fix bug when changing between RTL and LTR languages
This change focuses on switching the direction of website content,
but not the placement of UI elements. Beforehand the UI could jump
around in unexpected and strange ways

**** Synchronize play|pause of stream with audio playback
The play and pause buttons on the stream page were previously
disconnected from the audio stream. That meant you could pause
the stream, and still hear the audio. This change synchronizes
the play and pause buttons with audio playback so that when the
stream is paused, so is the audio

**** Pull audio duration from MP3 file
There was a bug in audio playback where the duration of an
audio file was always pulled from ~durations.json~ instead
of being pulled from the MP3 file. The fix for this bug saw
an overhaul of the audio implementation with significant
improvements to the audio player. Reported by [[https://github.com/farooqkz][@farooqkz]]

**** Add zoom for large screens
Apply zoom of 0.9 for devices with a height larger than
~$breakpoint-lg~, plus other ~_zoom.scss~ improvements

**** Update ryo.rb
Bump ryo.rb from 0.5.6 to 0.5.7

**** Add Bing verification
Add a verification meta tag to the root page. This change
will hopefully see Bing index ~al-quran.reflectslight.io~

**** Add robots.txt
Primarily for search engines (Google in particular)

* v0.10.2

**** Improve OpenGraph image
The OpenGraph image (~src/images/og/0.png~) has been regenerated
and it is based on ~src/images/favicon.svg~

**** Search engine optimization
Rewrite meta descriptions to be more descriptive and include more
text, as it appears Google have de-indexed the website since adopting
short meta descriptions

**** Remove unneccessary gzip compression
The builtin gzip compression provided by nanoc-gzip.rb is no longer
neccessary thanks to the compression provided by bunny.net

**** Remove ~/src/json/durations/*.json~
Related to the previous commit, the ~index.json~ file now contains
the duration of each ayah

**** Consolidate ~{info,surah,duration}.json~ into index.json
The ~{info,surah,duration}.json~ files have been consolidated into
a single file: index.json. This change reduces the number of requests
made by the ~surah-stream.html.erb~ page

**** Set custom zoom (0.8) on low resolution laptops
The website is now zoomed out by default on low resolution laptops.
My primary laptop has a resolution of 1366x768, and it was the driving
force behind this change

**** Add new icons
The play & pause icons from the native KaiOS application replace the
previous set of icons

* v0.10.1

**** Deliver audio via bunny.net
The audio content is now delivered via bunny.net, a CDN and
storage provider

**** Match the look and feel of a book
The look and feel of the website has changed to be more like
a book that could fit in the palm of your hand

**** Fix font bug for iOS users
On modern versions of iOS the "Amiri Quran Regular" font rendered
as invisible text. This change reverts to the "Amiri Regular" font
instead, which appears to render without any issues

**** Improve UX on large screens
On large screens - the content now has a maximum height
of ~$breakpoint-md~, and the content is both vertically
and horiztonally centered. At 2560x1080 the appearance is
similar to a book on a large blank space

**** Improve UX on touch screens
On touch screens it is now easier to change themes thanks to
a container that has a larger height and width than the theme
icon it contains. Along with this change, the theme icons have
become larger and less circular

**** Refactor themes
The theme implementation has been reduced to a set of colors
that are applied when the theme is active, and in the process
the creation of new themes has been made easier

**** Improve ~LanguageSelect.tsx~
RTL languages have ~Cairo Regular~ applied.
LTR languages have ~Kanit Regular~ applied

**** Add ~favicon.rake~
The new rake task ~favicon~ can generate the favicon set
from ~favicon.svg~ in a way that's reproducible and automated.

In the process the favicons have been regenerated, and
the book misalignment that was present in ~favicon.svg~
and the other favicons has been fixed

**** Apply Amiri font for Farsi
Same as Arabic

**** Optimize inline of ~postman.css~
The inlined CSS is minified before being inserted into HTML documents

**** Remove KaiOS breakpoints
There is a separate repository for KaiOS

* v0.10.0

**** Add Cairo fonts
Two new fonts for RTL languages: Cairo Regular, Cairo Bold

**** Render three columns on ~SurahIndex.tsx~
The ~SurahIndex.tsx~ component renders three columns for RTL
languages (compared with two columns before)

**** Revisit color scheme
Redo the website color scheme with a focus on improving the
Arabic / Farsi variants

**** Revisit ~SurahStream.tsx~ for RTL languages
The appearance of the ~SurahStream.tsx~ component was revisted
for RTL languages, especially Arabic

**** Add "Amiri Quran Regular" to ~SurahIndex.tsx~
The name of each surah is rendered in the Amiri Quran Regular
font in the Arabic locale / language

**** Add "Amiri Quran Regular" font
This new font is used specifically for the contents of a surah
in the Arabic locale / language

**** Replace custom z-index rule
Replace custom z-index rule with the CSS class ~.z-10~

**** Update tail.css
The vendored copy of ~tail.css~ has been updated

**** Add ~rake format:apply~
This new rake task tries to auto-correct typescript and
ruby lint errors

**** Apply larger font size in ~Head.tsx~
The text "The Noble Quran" has a larger size (~.text-2xl~)

**** Remove ~/robots.txt~
We don't need this file anymore. It was used to block crawlers
indexing audio content at /audio but audio content is now served
on a separate domain

**** Add file mode option to ~nanoc.yaml~
The file mode option can be set on the server's unix socket.
Default: ~ug=rw,o=~


* v0.9.1

**** Fix ~_opengraph.html.erb~ typos
Fix multiple issues with the render of ~_opengraph.html.erb~

**** Replace font-size rules with tail.css classes
Replace custom 'font-size' rules with standard tail.css
classes (eg text-lg)

**** Remove ~mada-regular.ttf~
The Arabic font is now based on standard web fonts rather than
a custom fonts.google.com font

**** Add ~src/js/main/vendor.ts~
The new vendor entry point bundles preact, and other
third party dependencies in a single file. This change
is an improvement imported from the ~kaios/main~ branch

**** Replace React with preact
The preact library is a lightweight alternative to React,
with a smaller footprint. This change is an improvement
imported from the ~kaios/main~ branch

**** Change default ~audio.base_url~
Set the default audio URL to
https://audio.al-quran.reflectslight.io/rifai

**** Improve KaiOS support
Optimize the layout for KaiOS devices through specialized
media queries. A new branch (~kaios/main~) will focus on
KaiOS support
